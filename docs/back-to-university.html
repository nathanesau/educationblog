    <p>There are some silver linings to a global pandemic.</p>
<p>All university courses are now remote. This allows me to do something I've wanted to do for a while... which is... take more computer science courses &#128515;.</p>
<p>Now, I know that most people who have already graduated don't use their free time to sign up for more university courses. But hear me out. I really liked university. Learning is fun and I always regretted not being able to take more computer science courses when I was in school studying actuarial science.</p>
<p>Fast forward a few years, and I am now a software engineer (<em>not an actuary anymore</em>) and although you can learn basically everything these days online, there are a few benefits to taking some university courses.</p>
<ul>
<li>When you are paying for a course, you are more likely to put in some serious effort</li>
<li>If I want to do a master's one day, doing well in some upper level computer science courses won't hurt</li>
<li>Networking opportunities with students and professors</li>
<li>Student perks (10% off groceries? Student credit cards?)</li>
</ul>
<p>So, I've signed up for <a href="https://www.sfu.ca/students/calendar/2021/spring/courses/cmpt/225.html">one computer science course</a> this semester. If I wasn't working maybe or could get my employer to reimburse me for more courses, maybe I would've done more. </p>
<p>I'll be taking the course at Simon Fraser University where I did my undergrad. Here is how far I live from the university. Glad I am don't have to make this commute &#128514;.</p>
<p><img src="img/2021_01/commute.PNG"></p>
<p>Should be a fun challenge. Would be embarassing if I don't do well in this course given that I work with data structures and algorithms everyday plus in my free time. We shall see.</p>
<p>Oh and hopefully, I will be able to take another course (Operating Systems) in the summer.</p>
